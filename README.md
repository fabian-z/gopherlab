# Archived: gopherlab is obsoleted by gophernotes
## Please use [the original project](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes)

The purpose of this fork was to add Jupyter v5 protocol and JupyterLab support to Go notebooks. Since then the original project has seen significant work (including v5 protocol support) and is now being actively maintained. Therefore, all users of this fork are encouraged to switch their usage to [gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes). Please also direct all further contributions there.

# gopherlab - Go in Jupyter Notebooks
[![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/fabian-z/gopherlab.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fabian-z/gopherlab)
[![Code quality report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab)

`gopherlab` is a Go kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, also supporting the still alpha [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterlab).
This allows for using Go in an interactive context, directly in the browser, making it ideal for educational uses and data science. 
Use `gopherlab` to create and share documents that contain live Go code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  These notebooks can then be shared with others via e-mail, GitHub, etc. 

The original `gophernotes` project came out of the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com/) 2016 and was inspired by a self-described as limited ipython kernel called [iGo](https://github.com/takluyver/igo).
The REPL backend of both `gophernotes` and `gopherlab` is provided by [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore).

## Installation

### Local, Linux

- Dependencies:

  - [Go](https://golang.org/) (Tested with Go 1.5 and 1.6)
  - Jupyter (see [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for more details on installing jupyter)
  - [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) (4.x, if you need another version please file an issue)

- Create a workspace and setup your `GOPATH`, see https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH



-   ```
    go get github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab
    ```
  

- Create a directory for the new kernel config:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gopherlab
  ```

- Copy the kernel config into the `jupyter` directory:

  ```
  cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab/kernel/* ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/
  ```
  
  Note, depending on which version of jupyter you are using and if you are using Anaconda, you may need to copy to `~/.ipython` rather than `~/.local/share`.

- Copy the gopherlab kernel to your kernels directory and add the correct path in `kernel.json`:

```
  cp -a $GOPATH/bin/gopherlab ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/
  
  sed -i "s#/go/bin/gopherlab#$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/gopherlab#g" $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/kernel.json
```

### Local, OSX

- Dependencies:

  - [Go](https://golang.org) (Tested with Go 1.8)
  - Jupyter and ZeroMQ
    - ```port install py36-jupyter py36-readline```

- Create a workspace and setup your `GOPATH`, see https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

-   ```
    go get github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab
    ```

- Create a directory for the new kernel config:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/gopherlab
  ```

- Copy the kernel config into the `jupyter` directory:

  ```
  cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabian-z/gopherlab/kernel/* ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/
  ```

- Fix path in `kernel.json`:
  ```
  sed -i.bak "s#/go/bin/gopherlab#$GOPATH/bin/gopherlab#g" ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/gopherlab/kernel.json
  ```

## Getting Started

- If you completed the install above start the jupyter notebook:

  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Alternatively, start the JupyterLab Alpha
 ```
 jupyter lab
 ```

- Select `Go (gopherlab)` from the `New` drop down menu.

- Have Fun!


## Troubleshooting

### gopherlab not found
- You will need to change the path to the `gopherlab` executable in `kernel/kernel.json`.  Above docs provide a `sed` command for this purpose. You should put the **full path** to the `gopherlab` executable here, and shouldn't have any further issues.


## Custom Commands
Some of the custom commands from the [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore) REPL have carried over to `gopherlab`.  Note, in particular, the syntax for importing packages:

```
:import <package path>  Import package
:print                  Show current source (currently prints to the terminal where the notebook server is running)
:write [<filename>]     Write out current source to file
:help                   List commands
```

Output support for these command is currently under construction, e.g. `:print` already works.

## Licenses

Original `gophernotes` was created by [Daniel Whitenack](http://www.datadan.io/). `gopherlab` was forked by Fabian Zaremba, in order to add new features, support new message spec (JupyterLab) and update several core components. Both projects are licensed under an [MIT-style License](LICENSE.md).
